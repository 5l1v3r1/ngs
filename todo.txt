Note that this started as internal document so things here are unformed, not final and fluid.

[inbox]

	Unsorted and undecided things go here. The important sections is [roadmap] and it's just below this section.


[roadmap]

	* Phase 1 - the language [in progress]

		* Milestone "documentation" [in progress]
			* Standardize and explain naming convention: function/method, attribute/property.
			* Generated [in progress]
				* Pages
					* Namespaces related
						* Namespaces list page: name, description
						* Namespace page
							* Types index
							* Links to types' pages
							* Methods. Mark which are additions to globals and which are local.
							* Constants
						* ???
					* Namespaced types and methods
						* Show namespace
					* { } in examples
			* Document AWS library (including usage examples)
				* Example: AWS::Elb().reject(X.Instances).delete()
			* Exit codes (see bootstrap.ngs and ngs.c)
			* Community examples: look at Kubernetes/examples/task/*,readme
			* Link from constructors to types
			* Type constructors and object creation
			* Nested namespaces (AWS::util)
			* "N methods" in link to namespace - filter by added implementations, don't count x in "global init; x = init"

		* Milestone "packaging"
			* Debian packages
			* Brew package
			* Arch Linux package
			* Install ngs syntax detection and highlighting for vim
			* Make multiple versions installable side by side, like Node.js

		* Milestone "programming"

			* files globbing
				consider special syntax such as <foo*bar>
				think about Res globbing

		* Milestone "modules"
			* require() - add search path
			* require() - allow relative to caller require
				* compile() - get list of "local" variables?
				* load() - pass these "local" variables?
				* require() - pass new require() function that knows base path?
				* require() - pass __FILENAME and maybe __DIRNAME?
			* require() - support algorithm+signature: modules can theoretically be fetched over network
			* consider pre- and post- require() hooks
			* versioning
				+ maybe "require('mymod', '=2.0.1')" like "use" in perl
				+ maybe "require('mymod', '2.0.1'..'2.0.9')" similar to perl but range
				+ maybe specifying methods' signatures
				+ maybe methods should be versioned (like in .so files)
				+ how different module versions can run alongside?

		* Milestone "even better documentation"
			* Tables documentation - examples
			* Finish c_* methods documentation
			* Add field (for example for Absent) for methods that get Arr[T] to link that method from type T page
			* Tags associated with methods/types/namespaces
			* Add "-pd" switch: print documentation
				+ Should take one of:
					+ Type
					+ Method
					+ Namespace
					+ Topic
				+ Add some method to list topics?
				+ Use pager?
				+ Simple formatting as plain text when no pandoc installed, man formatting when pandoc installed? Maybe pre-compiled man pages?
			* Internals

		* Milestone "correct programming"

			* Support multi-command / multi-line $(...) syntax

			* OS - make it a type, not a list booleans

			* See what can be fixed regarding functions that accept Arr[T] for specific types
				+ Such as join(threads:Arr) in lib/autoload/Thread.ngs

			* Rethink null/exception/Box
				+ F index
				+ F zip
				+ F pos
				+ {,e}{switch,match,cond}

			* ec2hostsfile.ngs - fix the tags filter

			* Syntax fixes
				* Fix operators priority for obj.Mod::method()
				* Fix syntax: "ifx" is now "if x"
				* Fix parser in
					function_call(
						with_comments,
						# syntax
						yes)
				* Fix $(separate$item issue)

			* Think about unification of Eachable and Iter
				* Maybe something resembling "yield"

			* Namespace type, probably subtype of Hash

			* decode_json - meaningful exceptions

			* Adding a field to a type is not thread safe because of possible fields hash (field name -> field number) update

			* [Doc.ngs] check why n = Node('html', children = tl.children) does not work

			* Option to turn backtraces on in warn() and error()
				* Make option for unique backtraces only

			* ns { F init(...) ... } -- forgetting "global init" is hard to debug

			* F main(a:Str, b:Str=null) is not matched when only one argument is passed
				happens because all matched arguments are treated as positional
				should implement keyword-only arguments first

			* Reconsider Int inheriting Eachable. Think 10.flatten() - very strange behaviour. Maybe Visitable/Traversable or alike is needed for containers.
			* Fix parser for # comments at end of line
			* MacOS warning: "gc repeated allocation of very large block"

			* Keyword only arguments
				* then think about File("/etc/myconfig")[lines='# start'..'# end'] = ['my', 'content']
			* AWS
				* Creating an AWS res not matching the Anchor - think
				* AWS fix SG rules (IpPermBox < IpPermBox)
					Make it work correctly when one rule is superset of another one
				* AWS::SecGroup - check whether Description is Anchor-only
				* AWS::Instance -- make sure Anchor works as expected
				* Add test for find(Vpc) isDefault property

			* Look for sets of C constants to move to namespaces
				+ C_PCRE_* - move to C_PCRE namespace?
				+ others?

			* Standardizing InvalidArgument
				+ offending value in .value
				+ other fields?

			* cmake - check that C macros exists (E..., RTLD_...) and make them available. Currently most of the are commented out due to Mac OS support.

			* File descriptors cleanup (close), especially when forking and making pipes

			* Check ArgvMatcher - why ec2din.ngs does not have F main(..., *filters) ?

			* Check executable bit before execve

			* Namespace: "ns { F f() ... }" when f is global, ns::f should only list f implementations defined in the namespace?

			* Check map* and filter* functions naming consistency

			* c_stat() / stat() - return timestamps too

			* Replace Command#options with Hash (currently Arr)

			* Fix - ngs: vm.c:2988: vm_run: Assertion `0=="Function does not have result value"' failed.
				F parse(s:Str, hints:Hash) {
					guard try hints['process'].command.argv[0] == 'find'
					# argv = hints['process'].command.argv
					# guard '-printf' not in argv
					# zero_sep = '-print0' in argv
					# if zero_sep then s.split('\0') else s.lines()
				}

			* Run exit_hook on CTRL+C (Throw exception)

			* Copy stderr to both stderr and to captured .stderr of the process

			* Bool(subtypes of Path) - kind of object (File, Dir, etc) must match to what's on disk

			* think about read/write vs read/echo methods naming

			* locals() - to complete globals()

			* Make sure attrs() are implemented on all possible types

			* OP_PUSH_INT - check limits of the number

			* Make comments that begin not at beginning of line work

			* Go over methods and make sure the method X types matrix is as full as possible

			* Partial application syntax
				* Make sure it works correct in expressions such as 10 + X * 2
				* Check that this works: f(X, *something, **some_kw)

			* Fix segfault in case of comments between cond clauses

			* Go over naming convention, making sure it's consistent and can be easily described in the manual

			* Binary safe strings
				* echo()
				* anywhere else?

			* Make sure not to leak FDs to processes that NGS runs
				+ See bash-4.3/execute_cmd.c, execute_in_subshell(), "fds_to_close"

			* Make sure STACK_DEPTH is correct everywhere and add tests

			* Implement missing local/upvar/global functionality and add tests

			* Make sure local/upvar cause exceptions when used at top-level code

			* Check what happens with misplaced local/upvar/global. Example: "F f(); global f" - function declaration causes f to be local

			* Make sure (uncaught) exceptions go to stderr, not stdout

			* get rid of expose() ?
				+ Used in Stats
				+ Probably needs inheritance from builtin types

			* get rid of nuke_null() ?
				+ Not used in current stdlib
				+ Think of use cases justifying existence of nuke_null()

			* break / continue - disable when not in for/while

			* -pedantic

			* check integer overflows everywhere

			* compile
				* exceptions instead of asserts
				* disallow duplicate name for an argument

			* Fix inspect() and maybe others to display special symbols in strings as \x.. or alike

			* -(Str, Ifx)

		* Milestone "threads"

			* pmap() - limit number of concurrent threads and/or make it dynamic
			* rethink exceptions in threads
			* Make ENV and current directory thread-local but allow access to the global ones
			* Thread - Make pthread_attr_t accessible - get/set attributes
			* Thread local variables
			* pthread_mutexattr_gettype()
			* pthread_mutexattr_destroy()
			* pthread_attr_destroy()


	* Phase 2 - the shell [not started]

		See beginning of CLI implementation in previous NGS implementation:
		https://github.com/ilyash/ngs/blob/0ed8455efe851e3c5a275290a71c38c4e718f15c/cli.ngs

		+ Information for contributors
			+ Contributors should research and understand first
				+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termcap
				+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)
				+ TERM environment variable
				+ libreadline - https://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html
				+ TTY / PTY - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoterminal
				+ TTY Signals - http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/
			+ CLI entry point is at lib/cli.ngs . It's called from lib/bootstrap.ngs
				+ Current CLI readline implementation is not meant to stay, readline will probably not be a good fit for NGS
				+ Current CLI readline implementation is based on unfinished FFI implementation, which is not stable (API can change)
			+ All UI functionality that is implemented should be able to gracefully degrade and work in TTY.

		* Milestone LayoutManager
			* Dynamic width support for Table and probably other objects on the screen

		* Milestone "screen layout"

			* Commands prompt and input area at the bottom

			* Processes have their own area on the screen
				+ Truncated stdout/stderr
				+ Option to view full stdout/stderr in a pager

		* Milestone "semantic output"

			* Needs software design: interactive objects and operations on them
				+ Interactive data types
				+ Protocol for specifying operations
				+ Should gracefully degrade when go to file or piped to another program instead of interactive UI
			* Allow navigation on the screen, choosing operations from a menu for the objects
			* History of operations in context menu
			* A way for external script to:
				* Detect that it's running under NGS
				* Return interactive objects (needs software design)
				* For NGS scripts which return Table this should be automatic

		* "borrow" status() behaviour from apt/apt-pkg/install-progress.cc
			switch to override and do:
			+ tmux title only
			+ gnome/whatever terminal title

	* Phase 3 - running code remotely

		* think about serialization and remote execution
			Probably pushing a bytecode (which we already have because the code was compiled)
			of a function that does not reference any upper-level variables, only locals and globals,
			maybe like this:

				RF myfunc(param1:Str, param2:Int, ...)

			RF means remote function and compiler checks for absence of upper-level variables references.

	* Phase 4 - assist developing

		* Local variables values in backtrace

		* tracing / debug

		* Add profiling info to ngs-debug
			+ memory allocations - where and how much
			+ opcodes stats
			+ method calls: scanned / not scanned (where in Arr the method was found)
			+ something about call sites?

	* Phase 5 - nice to have

		* Iter improvements
			* If migrating lines() to Iter
				+ remember to implement ==(Iter, Arr), as used in tests:
					fqdn = 'example.com'
					fqdns = `mybin list`.lines()
					assert(fqdns == [fqdn])
				+ make sure join() works
			* Iter[PredRange] - should return new Iter
			* zip(Iter, Iter)
			* limit(Iter, n)
			* intersperse(Iter, ...)
		* Inheriting built-in types without performance penalty (probably eliminates the need for ArrLike and HashLike)
		* assert_proc(cp:CommandsPipeline, exit_code, stdout, stderr)
		* Calling
			* Predicates in parameters list?
			* Immediate values in parameters list
			* Consider OneOf type for nullable parameters: F myfunc(a:Int, b:OneOf(Int, Null))
				also think about more traditional approach: F myfunc(a:Int, b:Box[Int])
		* Data manipulation
			* Make Indexable: Arr, Str, Range - this might save some code
			* update(Hash, key, value) - update specified key only if exists ?
			* update(Arr[Hash], key, value / Fun) - update specified key only if exists ?
			* Implement Hash(Arr[Str]) for strings of form "key=value"?
			* Add fetch(Path), maybe read(Path). Now have read(File)
			* "str" / [str]
			* '.'(Iter, Str) -> AttrIter or alike maybe MappingIter or child
			* Maybe Iter(b:Box)
		* Syntax
			* Conditional presence of an element in an array
		* assert_file / assert_file_exists ?
		* assert_has_line / assert_has_line_with ?
		* make ResDef ArrLike for the resources?
		* make Res HashLike?
		* last(?, predicate)
		* Consider Ref(h:Hash, k) and Ref(a:Arr, idx:Int)
		* add avg()
		* Address resolution functions
		* Consider somethig like data_strucure ~ [Capture("x"), 7 , "xx"]

		* Sub-typing built-in types
			* Subclass Fun? For mapper for example to know which arguments to pass and what to construct
		* dig with data_struct['a', 10, *, ...]
			* Not sure about the star, maybe:
				~All
				X ~ All

		* Method to push a value into Arr if it's not there already
		* Function static variables
			F parse(s:Str, ...)
			?static? re = /myregex/
			guard s ~ re
			...
		* Possible syntax of Arr[ElementsType]
			F +(s:Str, a:Arr[Str]) { ... }
			instead of
			F +(s:Str, a:Arr) { guard a.all(is, Str); ... }
			don't see any use now but for completeness: Hash[KeysType, ValuesType]
		* Completion-safe marker in scripts + completion protocol
		* Consider Syntax for stripping last newline character in `cmd`
		* ASN1 parser
		* while/for should return a value?
		* Make each(), filter() and friends be able to work on endless lists
		* Consider having chunk() method as in Ruby
		* Delimited string type, such as PATH
			+ ds = DelimStr(ENV.PATH, ':'); ds.each(echo); ds.push('mypath_element')

		* f'file literals'

		* Consider IP and subnet literals of the form:
			1.2.3.4
			1.2.3.4/8

		* Consider shortcut syntax for ENV.MYVAR
			maybe %MYVAR ?

		* Consider shortcut syntax for ARGV[n]
			feels like less needed than ENV.MYVAR

		* Go over "TODO"s in all *.ngs files

		* Better start time

		* benchmarks - different tasks and languages
			+ There is one task benchmark in the Makefile (time-sum target)

		* RegExp
			* c_pcre_exec() - support options?
				PCRE_NOTBOL
				PCRE_NOTEOL
			* c_pcre_study()

		* modules / namespaces

		* implement parse() wherever possible (example: IPAddr, IPNet)
			+ allow auto-load missing implementations by extension and mime type

		* push/pop/shift/unshift for Hash
			To be consistent with Arr, which has all of these.
			The push is regular h[k] = v while others need additional vm functionality.

		* match, ematch - some way to get the match object?

			+ Check if match is used before doing this task. Currently there is not single usage of match construct.

			For example when RegExp is implmeneted in the code

				match mystring {
					/my_regex(.*)/ { my_code }
				}

			in my_code there should be access to the match object
			The syntax might be

				match mystring {
					/my_regex(.*)/ -> my_match { my_code }
				}

			or something alike, not sure yet.
			Maybe

				match my_string my_match {
					/my_regex(.*)/ { my_code }
				}

		* Destructuring. Automatically declare the variables local, as for does.
			+ Check whether really needed. Currently would fit OK in several places in stdlib when returning few values from C calls:
				result = c_something(...)
				... result[0] ...
				... result[1] ...
				...
			* [a,b=default,*some,c]
			* {'a','b':newvar,**some,'c'=default}
			+ Not sure about the syntax.
			+ Nested?
			+ Pattern matching like [a, *other1, 100, b, *other2] ?
				+ If yes, shouldn't the syntax be tilde (~) as for RegExp/Pfx/Sfx/... ?
			+ "xyz${myvar}www" = myvar syntax for regexes? ... for consistency.
			+ {[_, dst], **args} = h means also changing function arguments?

		* text templates (stdlib with builtin parse I guess)

		* Nfile - NGS version of Makefile

		* Compile time stack depth check?

		* yaml
			* parse
			* generate

		* K M G suffixes for numbers

		* arbitrary length integers

		* Dynamic file names for use cases such as logger
			logger = DynFile('/var/log/...%h')
			logger.echo('my log event')

		* (UI) Suggested commands ("Command ... did not find any results. Try ..." - CLI menu)

		* digits() function?

		* Channels - Chan type & syntax
			Initial syntax thoughts:

			1..10 | map(X*2) | sum | echo

			a = Chan()
			b = Chan()
			1..10 | group({A % 2 ==0 }, a, b)
			a | { echo("Even number $A") }
			b | sum | { echo("Sum of odd numbers: $A") }

			F map(in:Chan, out:Chan, mapper:Fun) {
				# while in(&item) ?
				while in -> item {
					# out(mapper(item)) ?
					out <- mapper(item)
				}
			}

		* Intern strings automatically (see Python algorithm)
			+ do profiling first

		* Optimize calling speed
			* Optimize obj_is_of_type()
			* Optimize vm_call matching algorithm
			* Optimize calling of unrelated methods
				+ such as F f(t:T1) and F f(t:T2) when T1 and T2 are unrelated types

		* Optimize so that namespace items access ("namespace::item") will not have Hash lookups

		* Consider augeas integration

		* Documentation
			* Comparison and link to https://github.com/RexOps/Rex

		* Conditional modification of value
			* Condition can be Fun/value
			* Replacement can be Fun/value
			Syntax for common pattern, somewhat analogous to only():
			newval = if my_cond then my_func(my_val) else my_val

		* Consider introducing AnyVal / AnyRef types. These do _not_ correspond to BasicType and NormalType.
